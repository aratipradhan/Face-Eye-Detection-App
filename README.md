# Face-Eye-Detection-App
I've just built a face and eye detection web application using OpenCV, Streamlit, and Haar Cascades. The app allows you to either:

Detect faces and eyes in real-time using a webcam 🖥️📸

Upload an image for analysis, where it automatically detects and highlights faces and eyes 🖼️👀

Key Features:

Real-time face and eye detection via webcam feed

Image uploading functionality for offline processing

Interactive UI with custom background to enhance user experience

This project combines my passion for AI, computer vision, and data science. It’s an exciting step in exploring how computer vision can be applied to everyday use cases!
